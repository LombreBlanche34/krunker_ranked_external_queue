# HOW TO LOGIN
There are two ways to connect to your account: via client or via login:

- Client (not stable): Launch your client, make sure you are logged in and use the “detect token” function with the correct client. If your client is not in the list, you can add it in the “Settings” tab.

- Login (stable): Enter your username and password. The 2FA code will be requested if necessary. If the credentials are correct, you will be automatically redirected to the “Queue” tab.

The faceit sound will be play if a match is found, but keep an eye on it !
