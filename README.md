# External Ranked Queue

### How to i use this
If u dont know what u are doing, just select ur client and click "Get Token" (be sure to be logged in ur client first). If ur client is not on the list, u can add it with the "settings" tab after "queue".

If for some obscure reason you want to use ur username:pass instead of scrapping the JWT token, you can with the form.

If u are a pro and u know what u are doing, past ur AT in the last field.

The faceit sound will be play if a match is found, but keep an eye on it !
